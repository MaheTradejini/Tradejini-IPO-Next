          An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the process through which a
          private company offers its shares to the public for the first time and
          becomes publicly traded on a stock exchange. This allows the company
          to raise funds from retail and institutional investors, which can be
          used for purposes like business expansion, improving infrastructure,
          launching new projects, or paying off debts. For investors, an IPO
          provides an opportunity to invest early in a company and potentially
          benefit from its growth. However, it also involves risks, so careful
          analysis of the companyâ€™s financials and growth prospects is essential
          before investing.
